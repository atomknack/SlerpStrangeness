# SlerpStrangeness
Slerp strangeness, example how I do my math properly and no one owns the math, it contains bug that is probably from earliest versions of Editor

and made a lot of gamedevelopers suffer, and they don't even know why.
I am not good at communications and did not share it earlier days because - support forum is awful, bug request form is double awful.
I spent years on math and I not even good at it, but still always tried to do my part as diligent as possible.
